## Introduction

2D irregular packing problem is a kind of cutting and packing problem. It can be classified as  two-dimensional irregular open dimensional problem according to Wascher's paper.

To obtain a intial result, heuristic criteria is always 

In this respository, we replace 

## Architecture of the Network

The architecture of our network mainly consults works by Hu and Bello. In this achitecture, 。。。

## Training Procedure

- [ ] 简单图形的10个数据集的训练
- [ ] 考虑通用训练形状生成
  - [ ] 需要增加网络复杂度
- [ ] 考虑数据规模更大的情况

We only consider 





## Results and What we are doing now?

Based on datasets whose polygons have less than 8 edges, we can see the training result will be
